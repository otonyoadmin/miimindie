Trying to create great leadership contexts for successful leadership can no longer be left to human resource development modals that are bound to persona derived self conceptions as they are linear and brittle in a complex system.
We cannot keep asking for inspirational leadership to arise from an out of date mindset in people management. 

It is the absurdity of the confidence that drives someone like Boris Johnson, his clear inability to come to terms with the idea that his act is not good for society belies the problems in society that persona bound self conceptions.

One obvious system problem is that human resources systems seem unable to understand or want to make obvious the proven flaws and real risks involved in using derivatives of personas as self conceptions, catastrophic risks that Bankers and Quants could explain if the human resource people could hear and if the system will not let them hear they will not hear.

There is genuine problem that we are not releasing the creative potential that could be available from humans who can live in a mindful 1st manner which cannot conform to the persona structure as such a structure could not exist for Me-Mind so aligned. The attempts to shoe horn present awareness into persona self conceptions and call it mindfulness are playing with fire because the notion of the substantial self conception and the nature of emptiness do not mix without a self conception that can manage such awareness.


This is not a good guy bad guy argument this is an argument from reason and the problem is getting exponentially worse as career moves mean a need for a faster time to competence which can be helped if the system being used is competent before asking the people to be competent.

Self conception is used by virtually every teacher of complexity theory as an example of a complex system.

If you accept the Me-Mind argument that we live one time forward lifetime where new emergent knowledge emerges in the present and the distance between the knowledge emerging in the present, understanding and adaptation, measured in time would be an intersting metric to explore then person derived self conception cannot be used
