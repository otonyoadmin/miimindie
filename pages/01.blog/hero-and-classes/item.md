Starting in the solution we can observe that using EmptiSelf conception enables the Me-Mind paradigm shift which facilitates process orientation to continuously mother process purposes for the present. 

Subject object descriptions for objects of desire are linear by nature and not suitable for navigation in the present of a dynamically emergent field of knowledge and inner understanding, which is the core of the Me-Mind living one time forward lifetime in time bound evanescent iStates..

Hunting the snark is futile yet there are always enthusiastic crews led by sincere believers. The passion of the hunt is enthralling although lethally polluting of emergent knowledge as it puts the object that is unobtainable as the designator of statusl 

The language bound 'I Am' and 'I Want' are not capable of realizing satisfaction in the continuous flow of emergent knowledge flow.
Even when we come to mentally accept the soundness of the argument(s) that proves that it is impossible for a language bound persona to even express how or what would satisfy a Me-Mind we will continue to look for the image that by its nature cannot be found in inner experience.

will satisfy a Me-Mind  for more than a moment expression of desire in the form of an object


The [Quark theme](https://getgrav.org/downloads/themes) has the ability to allow pages to override some of the default options by letting the user set `body_classes` for any page.  The theme will merge the combination of the defaults with any `body_classes` set. This allows you to easily add hero classes to give your blog post some **bling**.

===

## Body Classes

```yaml
body_classes: "header-dark header-transparent"
```

On a particular page will ensure that page has those options enabled (assuming they are false by default).

## Hero Options

The hero template allows some options to be set in the page frontmatter. This is used by the modular `hero` as well as the blog and item templates to provide a more dynamic header.

```yaml
hero_classes: text-light title-h1h2 parallax overlay-dark-gradient hero-large
hero_image: road.jpg
hero_align: center
```

The `hero_classes` option allows a variety of hero classes to be set dynamically these include:

* `text-light` | `text-dark` - Controls if the text should be light or dark depending on the content
* `title-h1h2` - Enforced a close matched h1/h2 title pairing
* `parallax` - Enables a CSS-powered parallax effect
* `overlay-dark-gradient` - Displays a transparent gradient which further darkens the underlying image
* `overlay-light-gradient` - Displays a transparent gradient which further lightens the underlying image
* `overlay-dark` - Displays a solid transparent overlay which further darkens the underlying image
* `overlay-light` - Displays a solid transparent overlay which further darkens the underlying image
* `hero-fullscreen` | `hero-large` | `hero-medium` | `hero-small` | `hero-tiny` - Size of the hero block

The `hero_image` should point to an image file in the current page folder.
