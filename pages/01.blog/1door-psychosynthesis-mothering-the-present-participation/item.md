The EmptiSelf at the heart of 1 Door Psychosynthesis enables a special type of mothering will from non-Being into present participation.

The effortless pathways from the heart of 1 Door Psychosynthesis are paved with empty flag stones available in a human Me-Mind, willing to follow the emergent knowledge in the present.

The absurdity of persisting with the notion of human exceptionalism in this Universe, embedded in our self conception, is naive in light of our understanding of complex systems and how language is overtly incomplete when it comes to self description let alone conception.

When the facts of life undermine our understanding of our self conception, when not just God is dead, meaning made from feelings alone is dead, like the road from romance we may find ourselves travelling through this lesson time and again before we willingly understand the upstream and downstream consequences and adapt without pain.
