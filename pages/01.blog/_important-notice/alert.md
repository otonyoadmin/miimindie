The tools methods and approaches outlined here are for use in the development of professional knowledge flow management systems they are not suitable for use with personal neurotic psychological therapeutic issues.
There will be a limited number of people working as professionals in human knowledge management who will be able to use these methods as they call for an internal paradigm shift that hinges upon an EmptiSelf conception and eschews the persona bound psychological models of human self conception.

The profound nature of mindfulness resides in a void while here we live our lived experience oscillating between emptiness and form. The pause and become aware part of mindfulness has become a Western toy like all the ancient and sacred tools when reduced to the limitations of language and cultures bound to deluded sunken values, infected with an ontology that imputes human exceptionalism. The profound emptiness that can be revealed beyond the awareness of the interdependence is iconoclastic to the personal 'I'.

Mi~iMind begins from the perspective that an embodied  human Me~Mind, living one time forward lifetime, never steps into the same iState twice. This perspective changes the dynamic for the professional knowledge flow professional as it places the responsibility for managing professionalism in the Me~Mind employing the professional iStates in the professional roles we occupy. 

The methods require the capacity to develop clear core iStates for ground up feedback that can thrive upon error discoveries.

Please be aware these are professional knowledge tools that utilize the most advanced mindful self conceptions and they are not presented here for the personal use of non-professional users. These solutions require at least the capacity and willingness to understand the intellectual consequences of using the EmptiSelf conception provided as outlined in the 2 truths revealed in the Heart Sutra.  
Mindful 1st here means eschewing of persona bound self conceptions derived from ego/I and entailed Memes which use subject object contexts and using EmptiSelf conception which enables process orientation without structural resistances from debunked sunken values. 
**These are professional knowledge work solutions not a therapeutic interventions, although it is designed for use in professional interventions the solutions provided are designed to create the space for professional knowledge workers to design an deliver these emergent knowledge flow solutions from within their own disciplines. **
Not everybody will be able to fully understand the paradigm shift required as outlined here as the inner transformations require a willingness to follow the knowledge and the will in the ego/I self conception is bound 
The paradigm shift to process management dynamics is facilitated by the underlying scientific framework named Desire Dinamics and can be understood to work with the proposition that emergent knowledge arises in the present in each embodied individual Me-Mind, living one time forward lifetime.
