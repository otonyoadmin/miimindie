 Disabuse & Eradicate Persistent Persona Pollutants Of Emergent Knowledge Flow In Me-Mind
 
 There is an obvious limit to the amount of suffering that an ego/I bound self conception can bare in any Me-Mind, from the empathetic _I can't bare to watch the news everyday, to I cannot bare to think of a child dying of starvation every 4 seconds in this modern world where the stain on my shirt causes me more upset than thinking of how long it takes to die from starvation and what can powerless I do about it now anyway._ 

The systemic limitation of imagination entailed in persona I identities is made obvious within any Me-Mind as the acceptance of the impotence of personal 'I' identities is psychologically necessary to make continuation within the identity manageable. 

The self conceptions that are derived from Persona schematics are self limiting causes of self esteem issues. In the service of personal management of societal conformity these persona bound self conceptions are bound to static categories and linear hierarchies like Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
If Maslow's hierarchy of needs was suitable for use in a dynamic lived life then medical Doctors in first world medicine would have better mental health than gardeners.

result in debilitating self esteem issues.in relationship with brittle linear imprimatur among all hoi poloi personal bound self conceptions regardless of socio-economic status. Put another way when we are inhabiting hoi poloi iStates our self conception is derived from small men among small things by virtue of the systemic code being limited by natural language and subject object errors with hidden myth of the given imputations.
The servant master relationship is self limiting when it is considered as originating in some exception essential human identity whether it was Engles or Ayn Rand the limitations in the outset belie the nature of the end. 


The quant who presented the algorythem from which the derivative that broke the German scion's company owned by the elite German Industrialist who killed himself with shame is scrambling up the oiliegistic Hampton's social calender like her thinks he well be somebody when they say he is and not nobody like his beginnings in Morocco say to him he is.
