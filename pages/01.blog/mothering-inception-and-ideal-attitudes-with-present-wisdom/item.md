The faster dynamic emergence of new knowledge in each individual human Me-Mind using Mi-iMind mindful 1st solutions is aided by the use of resistance free ideal attitudes in Emptiself witnessed iStates for emergent knowledge processing using present wisdom.

A present wisdom word from the wise here warns that the traditional professional knowledge worker may from experience categorize this framing as similar to 'Act as If' a type of fake it until you make it strategy for survival which can be useful in wilfully error denying systems  

Continuous Mothering Of Diachronic Ideal Attitudes In One Time Forward Lifetime
Understanding faster using the Mi~iMind solutions cannot be achieved without a capacity to mother a null state of awareness, developing this capacity begins with learning how a particular understanding of emptiness can make receptivity effortless, while mothering is uncritically aware of the will in the present iState.

Mothering is always the receptive initializing attitude required to emerge from the chaos into the complexity within the Mi~iMInd mindful 1st embodied awareness process that guides the recollective development of ever better Positive, Present, Participation.

The cycle that captures the continuously emergent knowledge in a human Me-Mind needs to be open to receiving the emergent knowledge collected in ground up flattened hierarchies in the present if the information is to be qualified, classified and  

The [Quark theme](https://getgrav.org/downloads/themes) has the ability to allow pages to override some of the default options by letting the user set `body_classes` for any page.  The theme will merge the combination of the defaults with any `body_classes` set. This allows you to easily add hero classes to give your blog post some **bling**.

===

## Body Classes

```yaml
body_classes: "header-dark header-transparent"
```

On a particular page will ensure that page has those options enabled (assuming they are false by default).

## Hero Options

The hero template allows some options to be set in the page frontmatter. This is used by the modular `hero` as well as the blog and item templates to provide a more dynamic header.

```yaml
hero_classes: text-light title-h1h2 parallax overlay-light-gradient hero-large
hero_image: FILE703.JPG
hero_align: center
```

The `hero_classes` option allows a variety of hero classes to be set dynamically these include:

* `text-light` | `text-dark` - Controls if the text should be light or dark depending on the content
* `title-h1h2` - Enforced a close matched h1/h2 title pairing
* `parallax` - Enables a CSS-powered parallax effect
* `overlay-dark-gradient` - Displays a transparent gradient which further darkens the underlying image
* `overlay-light-gradient` - Displays a transparent gradient which further lightens the underlying image
* `overlay-dark` - Displays a solid transparent overlay which further darkens the underlying image
* `overlay-light` - Displays a solid transparent overlay which further darkens the underlying image
* `hero-fullscreen` | `hero-large` | `hero-medium` | `hero-small` | `hero-tiny` - Size of the hero block

The `hero_image` should point to an image file in the current page folder.
