Clear Core iStates provide the capacity for creating ground up present participation feed back loops in flattened hierarchies that enable process management.

The unique benefit of evanescent Clear-Core iStates arises from their nature as each Clear-Core iState is essentially open and willing to know, this iState is infinitely open and receives emergent knowledge without resistance, stress or enthusiasm.

The use of what are called iStates to denote states of awareness within a human Me-Mind, in the Mi-iMind solutions, essentially refers to time bound awareness in the present. 

The concept is simple by design as it seeks only to collect clear understanding of the current awareness in any present moment of any individual Me-Mind. The will or bias present in any iState such as those created by the accompanying feelings may be included  in the awareness of Clear-Core iStates without judgement. 

Will awareness provided by Clear-Core iStates enables subsequent reflective analysis using desire profiles.

Simple interpretations of present responses can be used in relationship with context free willed judgements such as instinctive yuck responses or mentally complex contextualized responses such as Schadenfreude which contains upstream and downstream assumptions. In both cases we can observe the presence of incomplete evaluation while each seeks to impute faulty sunken values in present participation.  

Clear core iStates have no other desire they do not seek a yes or a no in relationship with what is under consideration while at the same time the nature of the will present in the Me-Mind at the time of the awareness is of the utmost importance. 

The clear core iState is charged with noting the weak will or what can be referred to as a weak signalling of what the Me-Mind wants to be the case. The presence or absence of strong weak or indifferent will in relationship with identification in the attention at the present time under reflective attention.

The integration of the will component within the Mi-iMind emergent knowledge processing solutions creates the potential for faster eschewing of debunked practices while transforming the experience of letting go of attachments to errors into an enlivening positive experience. Errors are present polluters in the form of self doubt when self conception is derived from persona self conceptions in contrast to errors being corrections to a desired course when using the Mi-iMind  EmptiSelf conception. Navigating one time forward lifetime will require course corrections if the desired outcome is to be achieved.
