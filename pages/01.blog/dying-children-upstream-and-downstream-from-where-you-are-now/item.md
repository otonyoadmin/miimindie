The systemic space into which all human Me-Minds are invited to succeed curtails the best of us, while empowering the weakest as the consistencies of the Bell curve of the distributions leads the way in the everyday, where superior is simply above average looking down the Holon. 

Some things are only dangerous for people who can, winning the game they told you about is great if they knew the right game. Did anybody ask if you would like to play the present game where the goal and the path are one, where the Me-Mind you live in knows enough to know the right game and can be it, have you asked your self.

The present game is all about knowledge and the willingness to see what it is to be with clarity, without self esteem issues to create the best present possible and learn from every moment how few things there are that are not connected by anything that is not the value of a wave function. There are manifold infinities that are not humans and there are manifold infinities where humans can be.

In a complex system it is the quality of the ground up feedback loop that enables excellent, expert process management, if the iStates we live in are unwilling to face what is the case and act as is and not only as if.

The insights from micro dosing, Ayewaska or cult certainties are bound upon our return to our internal conversations by the language and the narrative two structural limitations that make such crude tools for describing Me-mind as clearly as a wide brush could paint an eylash on the Mona Lisa.

The solutions being proposed here begin with some understanding that far from equilibrium solutions may be wisely attempted for people with the capacity to use EmptiSelf conception.

The challenge is the paradigm change it requires within each individual. The system cannot sustain far from equilibrium solutions because it has a lust for structure that denies evolutionary discoveries sometime because it holds phantom sunken values.

Trying to create great leadership contexts for successful leadership can no longer be left to human resource development modals that are bound to persona derived self conceptions, as such conception are linear and brittle modals in a complex system.

We cannot keep asking for inspirational leadership to arise from an out of date systemic mindset in people management. 

The knowledge flow distortions caused by persona bound self conceptions, even in Latin and Greek, are there to see for all who will to see, seen in the absurdity of the confidence that drives someone like Boris Johnson, his clear inability to come to terms with the idea that his act is not good for society belies the problems in society that persona bound self conceptions can cause in a complex system like society. If he knows its bad for people and doesn't care that is OK, as he is just playing something like deceiver in a deceiver game, in his mind anyway, if he believes otherwise that is not OK.

One obvious system problem is that human resources systems seem unable to understand or want to make obvious the proven flaws and real risks involved in using derivatives of personas as self conceptions, catastrophic risks that Bankers and Quants could explain if the human resource people could hear and if the system will not let them hear they will not hear.

There is genuine problem that we are not releasing the creative potential that could be available from humans who can live in a mindful 1st manner which cannot conform to the persona structure as such a structure could not exist for Me-Mind so aligned. The attempts to shoe horn present awareness into persona self conceptions and call it mindfulness are playing with fire because the notion of the substantial self conception and the nature of emptiness do not mix without a self conception that can manage such awareness.

The problem with self referencing in language makes linguistic descriptions of self incomplete and we often hear reference to the incompleteness of the referencing system in pity asides like, _the map is not the territory_, the consequences of continuing to use the language is that we are curtailing the space into which the creative capacities of other humans. If it is not possible to to self describe in a human Me-Mind with language then we need to be aware that description are systemically constrained tools, which are self evidently unlikely to be able to invite and release the imagination of the best leaders available.   


This is not a good guy bad guy argument this is an argument from reason and the problem is getting exponentially worse as career moves mean a need for a faster time to competence which can be helped if the system being used is competent before asking the people to be competent.

Self conception is used by virtually every teacher of complexity theory as an example of a complex system.

If you accept the Me-Mind argument that we live one time forward lifetime where new emergent knowledge emerges in the present and the distance between the knowledge emerging in the present, understanding and adaptation, measured in time would be an intersting metric to explore then person derived self conception cannot be used
