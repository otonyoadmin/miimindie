Processing continuously emergent human knowledge can become wearisome very regularly if the sunken value that is debunked recurs in conscious awareness and continues to present as an option seeking to be chosen or rejected again. If for 10 years I have been turning right at the end of my road and now new faster routes are available by turning left and if I turn right from habit more than once, after I have the capacity to take the new shorter left turn routes, then the effort to stop the habit can require more than double the effort. One reason for this is often the tendency to start a dialogue about not thinking about it in the future which can become a bit like saying don't think of elephants in pursuit of forgetting elephants. This illustrates the self limiting recursion that can be caused by being over against a disposition.
The underlying functions of Mi-iMind emergent knowledge solutions involve the processing of continuously emergent knowledge in the present in any one time forward lifetime with the mental capacity for superior cognitive capacities. 

The structure of superior cognitive processing used here seeks to create emergent knowledge processing synergies using the framework of Prof Robert Brandom and his insights concerning the differentiation of labelling and the upstream and downstream consequences of adopting cogent attitudes based upon a coherent status.
Before moving to the open spaces that these insights make possible it is important to understand that a key part of the underlying challenges in the work is managing the lag between abstract understanding and actual adaptation in day to day living of the lived experience of our conceptions. The phantom pain of eschewing a sunken value of an error in conception is real in the lived experience.   
involves understanding the     



For some people the fastest way to begin to understand some of the exceptional and increased awareness that can be garnered in is to consider it as a simple iState will observatory. Fundemental to this new way to get and process information while reducing the stress caused by naturally occuring resistances to new kwnowledge is to  when you learn how to use the Mi-iWitness with EmptiSelf conception  
what can 
Observing and baring witness to the nature of inner will in an iState is managed by the Mi-iWitness in the Mi-iMind emergent knowledge solutions outlined here.

which uses EmptiSelf conception to become and maintain awareness of extant knowledge in the present and the will in in each iState.
