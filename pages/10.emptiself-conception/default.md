## **EmptiSelf Conception Is How**

## Now, in one time forward lifetime, is the where and when
Never the same evanescent iState in the present only the emptiness persists and pervades every present beyond this cohesion
The process orientation which is required to take advantage of the more inclusive progressive nature of evolution while including insights from the human strange loop access can be achieved using the EmptiSelf conception provided.
The EmptiSelf can be imagined as the null state of willing awareness where all that is in the iState is willingly witnessed without any positive or negative will. The idea is that if you can know this space of equilibrium in your mind then you can start calibrating better iStates from the inside out.
The issue with the self conceptions derived from persona conceptions is that they have affirmed sunken values that are misconceived and can be painful to remove for us all.

Process Orientation Is Effortless With EmptiSelf conception


### Access The EmptiSelf, Envision Emergent Knowledge Flow Solutions From Beyond Persona bound self conceptions.
The thesis is simple at its roots,
Each human Me-Mind is consciously aware via a Mi-iMind processing continuously emergent human knowledge in each one time forward lifetime of lived experiences in embodied space time. Present wisdom is used to provide a starting point for the process orientation and the obvious need for good judgement to be able to identify what is wisdom and what is present. 

1. Create a new [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository (hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or your own server) with at least one commit.
2. Tap the '[fa icon="cog"]Setup Git Sync' link on the far-right of the site navigation bar of this page for step-by-step instructions.
3. Configure the [Git Sync Link](../../admin/themes/mytheme) settings in the Theme options to change the display and functionality of the automatically displayed Git Sync Link.

### Embed Open Publishing Space Page Content into Other Systems

By adding the URL parameter (i.e. flag) `chromeless:true` to any Open Publishing Space page you can display that page's content without the global header image, site navigation bar, sidebar and footer - a great way to seamlessly embed Open Publishing Space pages into other systems.  

For example, the URL [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/) displays the standard Open Publishing Space blog post list page but the URL [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/chromeless:true](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-open-publishing-quark/chromeless:true) will only display that page's content. Any links between Open Publishing Space pages will result in pages being displayed in the same manner.
